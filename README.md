**rxl.js** is a simplified API Wrapper for Roblox made for beginners. I had the motivation to make this because of boredom(mostly) and I was hoping it could help out some people with their stuff. I am still maintaining this library and it is still under development since there's some little stuff I need to work on.

## How to install

Just run ``npm i rxl.js`` on your terminal and you're done!

## Examples

All code examples will be listed within the examples.js file (https://github.com/AstralNetwork/rxl.js/tree/main/examples). Everything is pretty simple and easy to save you the hassle of thinking out of your mind while implementing it. 

## Why rxl.js

rxl.js is a beginner friendly Roblox API Wrapper, meaning that everything within is simplified, easy to read and well organized.
