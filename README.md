## rxl.js

rxl.js is a simplified API Wrapper for Roblox made for beginners. I had the motivation to make this because of boredom(mostly) and I was hoping it could help out some people with their stuff. I am still maintaining this library and it is still under development since there's some little stuff I need to work on.

## How to install

Just run `npm i rxl.js` on your terminal and you're done!

## Examples

All code examples will be listed within the examples.js file. Everything is pretty simple and easy to save you the hassle of thinking out of your mind while implementing it.
